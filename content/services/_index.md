Modern software development is now more spontaneous, integrated, collaborative, and fine-grained than ever before. This creates a headache for transfer pricing managers because this makes it difficult to understand global software development workflows, adhere to the Arm’s Length Principle, and ensure tax compliance.

At Kolabri, we bring decades of experience in both worlds, software engineering and transfer pricing, and unravel the complexity of modern software engineering processes for your tax compliance. We offer multiple service packages to help you comply with necessary taxation regulations while not introducing impediments to software development.

Checkout our new brochure on [data analytics for transfer pricing in software engineering](/docs/Data%20Analytics%20for%20Transfer%20Pricing%20in%20Software%20Companies.pdf) to learn more about the approach underlying our consulting services.
