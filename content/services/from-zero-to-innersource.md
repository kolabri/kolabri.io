Adopting and scaling InnerSource is not a trivial task: Many companies we worked with are uncertain how and where to start. We have worked on InnerSource for nearly a decade: Currently, we are condensing this experience into our turn-key pipeline for helping you adopt, scale, and govern InnerSource: We call it _From Zero to InnerSource_.

With our _From Zero to InnerSource_ pipeline, we will offer you just the right service packages to not only get your company started with InnerSource but also sustainably scale InnerSource collaboration across the whole company and hundreds of projects.
The core idea behind _From Zero to InnerSource_ is simple: We start small with one or a few hand-selected pilot projects. Subsequently, we build on the success stories created with those pilots to grow InnerSource in your company step-by-step. For this, we utilize mechanisms from open source foundations and the InnerSource programs we have worked with, which have been proven time and time again.

We are currently in the last steps of designing the different components of the _From Zero to InnerSource_ pipeline. Do you want to be among the first to benefit? Reach out to us anytime. The service packages already give you a preview of some of the pipeline's components.

{{< accordion prefix="Package: " title="InnerSource Accelerator">}}
In this package, we help you build an InnerSource accelerator: The InnerSource accelerator is inspired by the Apache Software Foundation™ Incubator Program. It allows you to spawn high-quality InnerSource projects within your company continuously.

Once implemented, you can: 
- continuously identify suitable InnerSource project candidates
- coach InnerSource projects to success
- certify strategically important and mature projects
