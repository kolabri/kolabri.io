Such collaboration has an often overlooked legal implication: the profits from those cross-border collaborations become taxable.
In this second blog post in our series on tax compliance in software engineering, we will discuss the unique and fundamental challenges of taxing collaborative software engineering.</description></item><item><title>Tax Compliance in Software Engineering: What Is It All About?</title><link>/blog/2024/tax-compliance-in-software-engineering-what-is-it-all-about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Mar 2024 06:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/tax-compliance-in-software-engineering-what-is-it-all-about/</guid><description>by Michael Dorner Modern software systems are often too large, too complex, and evolving too fast for single developers to oversee.

In this first blog post in our series on tax compliance in software engineering, we start with a gentle introduction to international standards in multinational taxation and its basic Arm&amp;rsquo;s Length Principle from a software engineering perspective.</description></item><item><title>Preprint "Taxing Collaborative Software Engineering" available</title><link>/blog/2023/preprint-taxing-collaborative-software-engineering/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 06:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/preprint-taxing-collaborative-software-engineering/</guid><description>by Michael Dorner We just submitted our newest publication in the field of tension between collaborative software engineering and its taxation. This article is a comparably easy read (considering the complex topic) and a perfect introduction to the challenges of taxing collaborative software engineering in multinational enterprises.
Abstract The engineering of complex software systems is often the result of a highly collaborative effort. However, collaboration within a multinational enterprise has an overlooked legal implication when developers collaborate across national borders: It is taxable.</description></item><item><title>ESEM 2022 Best Paper Award for Kolabri's Michael Dorner</title><link>/blog/2022/esem-best-paper-award-michael-dorner/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/esem-best-paper-award-michael-dorner/</guid><description>by Maximilian Capraro Congratulations to our very own Michael Dorner for winning the Best Paper Award at the prestigious 16th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement.
Michael received the award a study carried out with his colleagues at BTH Karlskrona quantifying how information can be distributed through large organizations using code review feedback. We are already looking forward to use the insights of Michael&amp;rsquo;s research to support our clients practicing even more purposeful workflows for software development collaboration and InnerSource.</description></item><item><title>Talk Announcement: Transfer Pricing for InnerSource - Done Right (InnerSource Commons Summit 2022)</title><link>/blog/2022/announcement-transfer-pricing-talk-innersource-commons-summit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2022 14:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/announcement-transfer-pricing-talk-innersource-commons-summit/</guid><description>by Maximilian Capraro We are happy to be part of the lineup for the InnerSource Commons Summit 2022 (16th &amp;amp; 17th November 2022, online).
