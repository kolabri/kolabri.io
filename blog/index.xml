Michael received the award a study carried out with his colleagues at BTH Karlskrona quantifying how information can be distributed through large organizations using code review feedback. We are already looking forward to use the insights of Michael&amp;rsquo;s research to support our clients practicing even more purposeful workflows for software development collaboration and InnerSource.</description></item><item><title>Talk Announcement: Transfer Pricing for InnerSource - Done Right (InnerSource Commons Summit 2022)</title><link>/blog/2022/announcement-transfer-pricing-talk-innersource-commons-summit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Oct 2022 14:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/announcement-transfer-pricing-talk-innersource-commons-summit/</guid><description>by Maximilian Capraro We are happy to be part of the lineup for the InnerSource Commons Summit 2022 (16th &amp;amp; 17th November 2022, online).
